# advbinfmt from RootWyrm

This is a 'more advanced' binfmt solution for Docker buildx. Where by 'more advanced' I mean 'it's built with a much newer or more stable qemu.' 

As a result, it generally tends to be faster. This is not a bad thing.

# Using it for your buildx
It's really simple. Pick a version from the list below.

* 4.2.1 - June 25, 2020
  `docker run --rm --privileged docker.io/rootwyrm/advbinfmt:4.2.1`
