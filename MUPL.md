methods. If a COVERED USER makes documented and verifiable attempts to contact the author at all provided contact points, and 
receives no response in the affirmative OR negative within 365 calendar days (1 calendar year,) the COVERED USER is granted 
CONSENT THROUGH NEGLECT which shall be considered the same as EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT. A COVERED USER which has obtained CONSENT
THROUGH NEGLECT is indemnified from any claims of copyright infringement by the author and is entitled to use this license as

material. NEGATIVE responses DO NOT require VERIFIABLE CORRESPONDENCE. Examples of AFFIRMATIVELY ATTRIBUTABLE correspondence
include but are not limited to traditional signature, PGP/GPG signed-and-encrypted correspondence, or forms of verifiable PKI
signatures.

## EXCEPTIONS FOR PATCHES
A PATCH MUST make FUNCTIONAL OR SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATIONS to COVERED CODE to be considered a PATCH. Moving ORIGINAL CODE within a file or to a different file, only changing function or variable names, or simply reordering ORIGINAL CODE is NOT considered a PATCH and does NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY EXEMPTIONS. 

Where a COVERED USER develops a PATCH which complies with these license terms, a LIMITED EXCEPTION is granted for the COVERED USER to INCLUDE AND REDISTRIBUTE a MAXIMUM of TWO (2) lines ABOVE THE POINT THE PATCH IS TO BE INSERTED and ADDITIONALLY a MAXIMUM of TWO (2) lines BELOW THE POINT THE PATCH IS TO BE INSERTED for a total maximum of FOUR (4) LINES. THIS EXCEPTION ONLY APPLIES WHEN A PATCH IS "FUZZY" (NON-ABSOLUTE LINE NUMBER PLACEMENT) AND RELIES ON COVERED CODE TO DETERMINE PLACEMENT WITHIN A FILE.

Where a COVERED USER develops a PATCH which complies with these license terms, a LIMITED EXCEPTION is granted for INCIDNDENTALLY INCLUDED COVERED CODE. INCINDENTALLY INCLUDED COVERED CODE is defined explicitly as ONE LINE OF COVERED CODE which the COVERED PATCH must MODIFY, and such MODIFICATIONS must include changes OTHER THAN TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OR WHITESPACE. This definition is EXPANDED to include ONE (1) line of COVERED ORIGINAL CODE which may be used to DETERMINE LOCATION AND PLACEMENT per FIVE (5) lines of PATCH CODE INCLUDING THE ONE (1) LINE OF COVERED ORIGINAL CODE.
